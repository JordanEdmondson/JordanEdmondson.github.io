									<h2 class="major">A Bit About Me</h2>
									<p>Born and raised in Australia, I was an army brat who managed to live in almost every state of the country before my 12th Birthday. Following that, I made the move to Tasmania and have lived here every since. 
										Now twenty-two, I’ve completed my college studies and following that, completed a Certificate 3 in IT. With this certification, I was able to introduce myself to the industry of IT when I was given a job as an Analyst/Quality Assurance consultant for an Australian IT Consultancy company. Having been in this position now for almost two years, I like to think I have learnt quite a bit about the industry. 
										Outside of work, I spend a lot of my time either behind the viewfinder of a camera, or behind a keyboard and a monitor playing computer games. I have a very keen interest in both and have spent almost my whole life attached to the latter.

									<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>As mentioned, my interest in IT has been a lifelong affair. Some of my earliest memories consist of playing 2D platformers on my Grandfather’s pre-historic Apple Macintosh and since then I have essentially been attached to a computer.
										<br> Outside of PC’s, I have also always had a fascination with IT and its rapidly evolving nature in general. With seemingly endless leaps and bounds in technological advancement, I have made it my mission to try and keep up with the latest and greatest and have been captivated by the sheer complexity involved in such products.</br>
										It was this passion for technology that ended up pointing me in the direction of a career in the industry. As mentioned above, I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to work as an IT consultant for the past 2 years. Working mainly on platform-based technologies (Such as ServiceNow), I have learnt a lot about business-oriented technologies. Prior to being involved in the corporate world, I had no idea how much IT plays a part in the day to day of almost every sector of business. 
										Despite all my interest in the area though, I have never really learnt the fundamentals of it. I therefore made the decision to start studying a bachelor of IT with RMIT. To be able to learn how to read programming languages and code my own software, or to be able to understand the fundamentals of networking are both examples of skills that I have always been extremely eager to learn. Now that I am at a stage of my life where I can do this, I’m extremely eager to make the most of the opportunity. 
										From these studies, I am hoping to gain the skills needed to transition in to more of a technical role in the industry. Reading and writing code, understanding networking solutions, learning the fundamentals of hardware/software relationships are all pieces of knowledge that I am hoping to acquire from my time with RMIT.

											The position linked above is for a position as a Senior Gameplay Programmer with specialized skills in the Unreal Engine 4 environment. The company making the recruitment call is Jagex, a well-known and well respected MMO developer/publisher based out of the UK. I have chosen to feature this advertisement as I have been a big fan of Jagex and their products for over 15 years now. Working with the development team for this company has been a dream of mine for years and I have always considered it to be my ideal job.
											As seen in the advertisement, the main skill that is being requested for the position is that the applicant have Unreal Engine 4 knowledge.  Besides this, it is also calling for various other areas of technical knowledge such as C++ and a general coding background. 
										<br>Outside of the technical skillset, the advertisement also calls for the applicant to have knowledge in product delivery frameworks such as AGILE/SCRUM and certain soft-skills such as verbal/writing skills and problem-solving ability. </br>
											Before I could ever hope to be considered for this position, I would first need to meet the technical skillset specifications. While my work experience has taught me about the product management side of things (Agile, ITIL processes, etc.), I would of course need to be able combine that with a technical ability.
											As such, through my studies at university, I hope to achieve that skillset. Throughout my Bachelor of IT at RMIT, I am planning on focusing my attention on the more technical/programming-oriented subjects. Once I have the fundamentals of this secured, I will then be able to branch out in to further studies of specific programming languages. The more languages I learn, the more I hope to build my personal profile and in turn, be given more opportunities to apply for positions such as the one I have listed above.

									<p>For the most part, the results above match up to what I would have expected to score in each of these tests. The Meyers-Briggs test reflecting a more introverted, intuitive nature matches well with what I would generally classify myself to be. This is also true for the Learning Style test. I have always been much better at learning through visual mediums. I also agree with the results of the Career Test, however I would definitely not consider myself to be very artistic. 
										When it comes to teamwork, I think the biggest thing that stands out from these results is the fact that I am introverted. By nature, this could make team building slightly difficult, especially with new people that I have never met before. However, I think that I would be able to overcome this quickly once I got past the initial nervousness. 
										When forming a team, I will not only consider my own introverted nature, but the potential introverted nature of others in the team. I think this is important to be aware of as to avoid making anyone uncomfortable or feel awkward.

												The project idea I have chosen is to build a locally played, 2-player digital chess game. This will have a graphical interface which follows the traditional game and includes all relevant aspects of it such as the game board and its pieces. Pieces will be programmed to follow the traditional rules of chess, wherein each piece has its own move set, limitations, etc. As in traditional chess, there will be two ‘sides’, one white and one black, all with matching pieces, with each player controlling their own side. 
												The main motivators behind this project idea are simple, I really enjoy chess and have always wanted to build my own game. This product will not fit in to any kind of missing niche in the market, the game has been around for centuries has seen countless reproductions in all kinds of different forms. Personally though, I would really enjoy the project as it would give me the opportunity to critically analyse the game in a coding sense, rather than a game sense. 
												To look at it through the lens of each piece’s individual ruleset and the mechanisms behind them would be very interesting. Further to this, I believe that it would be a good opportunity to give a grounding practice in programming. With the compartmented nature of building such a game, it would give a good insight to the nature of coding and how each object built is made to fulfil a specific purpose in the scheme of the project as a whole.

												To achieve this, as traditional chess normally is, the game will be split into two sides with each side’s pieces playing from the opposite to the other. Each side will have their own set of the traditional pieces: 
										<ul>
											<li>8 Pawns</li>
											<li>8 Pawns</li>
											<li>2 Knights</li>
											<li>2 Bishops</li>
											<li>1 Queen</li>
											<li>1 King</li>
										</ul>

												Each piece will be coded to follow its traditional ruleset (Ie., Bishops able to move diagonally only, etc.). Each ruleset would need to be programmed individually so to create an object. These objects would then be set on the game board, an 8x8 checkered sequence of black and white squares.
												This game board would be programmed as a grouping of coordinates ranging from A-1 to H-8 with the letter value being placed on the x axis and the number value being placed on the y axis.

											To move a piece, the player who’s turn it is will click on the piece to select it, then click on the square of the board they would like the piece to be moved to. The piece will then move to that square (As long as it is a valid selection based on the piece’s move set). If the piece moves to a square which an opposing players piece occupies, the opposing player will lose that piece and the square will then be occupied by the player who made the move. Pieces that have been taken will be displayed in the game window, to the side of the game board. 
											Once a player’s move is over, the opposing player will then be able to select one of their pieces and play their turn. This will go back and forth until either one player forfeits or is checkmated. 
											The checkmate mechanic will be automatic in the sense that the game will detect when a King piece has no available squares to move to. Following this trigger, the game will end and a message will be displayed announcing the winner alongside an option to play again or quit the game. Wins for each player will be tracked via a number displayed in the game window so that players know how many times they have defeated or been defeated by their opponent.

												Once the base functionality has all been designed and confirmed as functional, there could also be potential to expanding this project to include an AI component. 
												Considering the lack of experience, coding this AI from scratch would not be feasible. However, there a numerous open source Chess AI libraries online that could be leveraged instead (If the project guild lines permitted it of course). Depending on the libraries available, a difficulty selector could also be implemented. Further research would be required though to confirm the possibility of this implementation though. 
												Due to its object-based nature, Python software would most likely be the best developer tool to develop this product. The language itself would fit well into the compartmental nature of building each individual chess piece and their corresponding ruleset. Pygame could also be used alongside this to develop the graphics and sound aspects due to the platform’s abundant existing libraries. 
												If this is to be a group project, project management tools could also be utilised to track progress and communicate blockers or work to be done between project members. A Kanban board software such as Trello could be used as a single source of truth to track the progress of individual tasks to be done and who each task is assigned to. Communication could be handled via a social media platform or a group chat forum of some kind.

												Aside from software, anyone involved in the project would also require their own personal computers to work on building the game. 
												Being built on Python, project workers would require some base programming skills but considering the introductory nature of this course, a willingness to learn as they go would be the main driving factor to success. With Python, Trello and social media platforms all being free to access, the acquisition of these should not cause any issues. 
												The end product will be a fully functional, 2-player, locally played digital chess game. All rules of the game will have been programmed and tested for verification. From producing this, all project workers involved would have been given a good grounding knowledge of Python and the compartmented mindset of a programmer.
